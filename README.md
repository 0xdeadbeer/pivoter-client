# Pivoter

Pivoter (Client) is an educational spyware built specifically for Windows devices. 
It uses the WinApi to log keystrokes and sends them to the [Pivoter Server](https://github.com/0xdeadbeer/pivoter-server).

Data is encrypted with AES-128, converted to base64, and sent to the Pivoter Server through a webapi (POST requests).
